            Hello everyone my name is Matthew Mitchell and I am majoring in Computer Science at Centenary University in Hackettstown, New Jersey.<br>
            My major and interests/hobbies are aligned, so outside of schoolwork I like messing around with computers.

        <h2 class="hobby-header">Favorite Hobby</h2>
        <p class="hobby">
            My favorite hobby is playing video games. I mainly play singleplayer games<br>
            as I enjoy the stories that they tell. Recently, I have began playing Playstation 2<br>
            games on my computer via emulation, and so far I am enjoying them. It is interesting to<br>
            see the progression of video games over time, and many of the stories and gameplay have aged well.
